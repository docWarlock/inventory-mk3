# Feature Specification: Room Model

**Feature Branch**: `002-room-model`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create the Room model for the home inventory system with Gridfinity support"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the home inventory system, I want to create and manage rooms so that I can organize my inventory within each house at a more granular level.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user accessing the system, **When** they create their first room, **Then** the room should be stored with all required metadata including name, associated house ID, and creation timestamp.
2. **Given** an existing room in the system, **When** I update room details, **Then** the updated information should persist correctly.
3. **Given** multiple rooms exist within a house, **When** I list rooms for that house, **Then** all rooms should be returned with their complete information.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a room name is empty or contains invalid characters?
- How does system handle duplicate room names within the same house?
- What if no description is provided for a room?
- How are rooms associated with houses?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create rooms with a unique name and associated house ID
- **FR-002**: System MUST store room metadata including creation timestamp and last modified timestamp
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to retrieve individual rooms by ID
- **FR-004**: System MUST support listing all rooms for a specific house
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to update room details including name, description, and dimensions
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow deletion of rooms (with appropriate cascade behavior for child entities)
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that room names are unique within the same house
- **FR-008**: System MUST support Gridfinity-specific container dimensions for visual reference and organization purposes
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow rooms to be associated with houses through house ID references

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Room**: Represents a room within a house with properties:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
  - `name`: Human-readable name of the room (required, unique within house)
  - `house_id`: Identifier of the house this room belongs to (required)
  - `description`: Description of the room (optional)
  - `dimensions`: Standard dimensions for the room (optional)
  - `created_at`: Timestamp when room was created
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp when room was last updated

# Implementation Tasks: House Model

**Feature**: House Model  
**Branch**: 001-house-model  
**Status**: Draft  
**Created**: 2025-09-08

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Foundation
- [ ] Create directory structure in `internal/houses/`
- [ ] Set up database connection for houses module
- [ ] Create base models file (`internal/houses/models.go`)
- [ ] Create repository interface (`internal/houses/repository.go`)
- [ ] Create service interface (`internal/houses/service.go`)
- [ ] Create handler interface (`internal/houses/handler.go`)

### Phase 2: Data Model Implementation
- [ ] Define House struct with all required fields
- [ ] Implement UUID generation for house IDs
- [ ] Set up timestamp handling (created_at, updated_at)
- [ ] Implement JSON serialization for dimensions field
- [ ] Create database schema migration for houses table
- [ ] Implement data validation logic

### Phase 3: Repository Layer
- [ ] Implement HouseRepository interface methods
- [ ] Create SQLite implementation of house repository
- [ ] Implement createHouse method
- [ ] Implement getHouseByID method
- [ ] Implement listHouses method
- [ ] Implement updateHouse method
- [ ] Implement deleteHouse method
- [ ] Implement unique name constraint check

### Phase 4: Service Layer
- [ ] Implement HouseService interface methods
- [ ] Create business logic for house creation
- [ ] Create business logic for house retrieval
- [ ] Create business logic for house listing
- [ ] Create business logic for house updates
- [ ] Create business logic for house deletion
- [ ] Implement duplicate name validation
- [ ] Implement data integrity checks

### Phase 5: HTTP Handlers
- [ ] Implement POST /houses endpoint
- [ ] Implement GET /houses/{id} endpoint
- [ ] Implement GET /houses endpoint
- [ ] Implement PUT /houses/{id} endpoint
- [ ] Implement DELETE /houses/{id} endpoint
- [ ] Create error handling middleware for house operations
- [ ] Implement authentication checks

### Phase 6: Testing
- [ ] Write contract tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Write unit tests for House model
- [ ] Write unit tests for House repository
- [ ] Write integration tests for House service
- [ ] Write end-to-end tests for house workflow
- [ ] Ensure all tests fail before implementation
- [ ] Implement code to make tests pass
- [ ] Verify test coverage meets requirements

### Phase 7: Documentation and Validation
- [ ] Update spec.md with any implementation insights
- [ ] Update research.md with final technical decisions
- [ ] Validate that all requirements from spec are met
- [ ] Ensure plan.md aligns with actual implementation
- [ ] Run final validation against project overview
- [ ] Document any deviations from original plan

## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path Tasks
1. Database setup (Phase 1)
2. Data model definition (Phase 2) 
3. Repository implementation (Phase 3)
4. Service layer implementation (Phase 4)
5. HTTP handlers (Phase 5)
6. Testing (Phase 6)

### Supporting Tasks
- Error handling and validation (runs throughout)
- Documentation updates (continuous)
- Integration with main application (Phase 1)

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements Met
- [ ] House creation with unique name validation
- [ ] House retrieval by ID
- [ ] House listing functionality
- [ ] House update capabilities
- [ ] House deletion with cascade behavior
- [ ] Standard dimension support
- [ ] Timestamp management

### Technical Requirements Met
- [ ] UUID primary keys for global uniqueness
- [ ] Database constraints enforced
- [ ] Proper error handling and HTTP status codes
- [ ] JSON serialization for dimensions field
- [ ] Test coverage > 90%
- [ ] Follows clean architecture principles

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No implementation details in spec/research
- [ ] Documentation consistent with implementation
- [ ] Code follows project coding standards
- [ ] Security considerations implemented

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Database Migration Conflicts**
   - *Mitigation*: Use database migration tools, test migrations thoroughly

2. **Duplicate Name Validation**
   - *Mitigation*: Implement both application and database level constraints

3. **API Consistency**
   - *Mitigation*: Follow REST conventions strictly, maintain consistent response formats

4. **Test Coverage Gaps**
   - *Mitigation*: Use code coverage tools, review test plan before implementation

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2 hours (Setup)
- **Phase 2**: 3 hours (Models)  
- **Phase 3**: 4 hours (Repository)
- **Phase 4**: 3 hours (Service)
- **Phase 5**: 3 hours (Handlers)
- **Phase 6**: 4 hours (Testing)
- **Phase 7**: 2 hours (Validation)

**Total Estimated Time**: 21 hours

## Review Checkpoints
- [ ] Initial setup complete
- [ ] Core functionality working
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Requirements validation complete

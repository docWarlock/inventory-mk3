# Research: House Model Implementation

**Feature**: House Model  
**Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Complete

## Overview
This document captures the technical research and decisions made for implementing the House model in the home inventory system. The research informs the architecture choices, database design, and API considerations for this foundational entity.

## Technical Decisions

### Database Design
- **Storage**: SQLite for MVP (can be extended to PostgreSQL)
- **Primary Key**: UUID string for global uniqueness
- **Indexing**: 
  - Primary key index on `id`
  - Unique index on `name` for uniqueness constraint
- **Data Types**:
  - `id`: TEXT (UUID format)
  - `name`: TEXT (required, unique)
  - `address`: TEXT (optional)
  - `total_area`: REAL/NUMERIC (for area measurements)
  - `unit`: TEXT (for unit of measurement)
  - `created_at`: DATETIME/TIMESTAMP
  - `updated_at`: DATETIME/TIMESTAMP

### Database Integration Implementation
- **Connection**: SQLite database properly configured in main.go with correct path construction
- **Migration**: Database schema created with proper constraints and indexes
- **Repository Pattern**: Implemented house repository with full CRUD operations
- **Dependency Injection**: House repository integrated into service layer
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for database operations with descriptive messages

### API Contract Research
- **Endpoint Structure**: RESTful design following standard CRUD patterns
- **HTTP Methods**:
  - POST /houses - Create new house
  - GET /houses/{id} - Retrieve house by ID
  - GET /houses - List all houses
  - PUT /houses/{id} - Update house
  - DELETE /houses/{id} - Delete house
- **Response Format**: JSON with consistent structure
- **Error Handling**: Standard HTTP status codes with descriptive messages

### Data Validation
- **Name Validation**:
  - Required field
  - Unique constraint enforced at database level
  - Maximum length: 255 characters
- **Address Validation**:
  - Optional field
  - Maximum length: 500 characters
- **Total Area Validation**:
  - Optional numeric field
  - Must be positive if provided
  - Unit of measurement required if area is specified


### Performance Considerations
- **Query Optimization**: 
  - Index on `name` for fast duplicate checking
  - Efficient timestamp handling
- **Caching Strategy**: 
  - No caching needed for house list (small dataset)
  - Individual house retrieval can be cached if needed
- **Scalability**:
  - UUID primary keys support distributed systems
  - Standard database operations scale well

## Architecture Patterns

### Clean Architecture
Following the project's clean architecture principles:
- **Models**: Data structures for house entity
- **Repository**: Database access layer (interface + implementation)
- **Service**: Business logic layer
- **Handler**: HTTP endpoint layer

### Security Considerations
- Input sanitization for all fields
- Authentication required for all operations
- Authorization checks to ensure users can only access their houses
- Protection against SQL injection through parameterized queries

## Implementation Constraints

### Dependencies
1. Database connection module
2. Authentication middleware
3. Common model utilities
4. Testing framework

### Future Expansion
- Support for different database backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Integration with spatial databases for advanced grid support
- Enhanced dimension validation for future Gridfinity features at container level

## Frontend Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
- **HouseList Component**: Displays a list of houses in a table format with edit and view rooms links. Includes delete functionality with confirmation dialog.
- **HouseForm Component**: Provides a form for creating new houses and editing existing houses with validation for required fields and unique name constraint.

### Navigation Flow
- Main house listing page at `/houses`
- Create new house at `/houses/new` 
- Edit existing house at `/houses/:id/edit`
- View rooms for a house at `/houses/:id/rooms`

### API Integration
- Uses `apiClient` utility for all HTTP requests
- Implements proper error handling and loading states

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Duplicate House Names
- **Mitigation**: Database unique constraint on name field
- **Handling**: Return appropriate HTTP 409 Conflict status

### Risk: Large Dimension Data
- **Mitigation**: JSON schema validation
- **Handling**: Limit dimension object size

### Risk: Performance Degradation
- **Mitigation**: Proper indexing and query optimization
- **Handling**: Monitor slow queries in production

## Tools and Libraries
- Go standard library for core functionality
- SQLite driver for database operations
- Testing framework (go test)
- JSON marshaling/unmarshaling utilities

## Test Strategy
- Unit tests for models and services
- Integration tests for repository layer
- Contract tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for complete workflow

## Decision Justification
The research decisions reflect the project's requirements for:
1. **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns
2. **TDD-first approach**: Research informs test creation
3. **Scalability**: UUIDs and standard database patterns
4. **Maintainability**: Clear architecture and documentation
5. **Cyberpunk UI compatibility**: Data structure supports the visual navigation requirements

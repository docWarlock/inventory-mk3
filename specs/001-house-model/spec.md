# Feature Specification: House Model

**Feature Branch**: `001-house-model`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create the House model for the home inventory system with Gridfinity support"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the home inventory system, I want to create and manage houses so that I can organize my inventory across multiple residential locations in a granular manner.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user accessing the system, **When** they create their first house, **Then** the house should be stored with all required metadata including name, address, and creation timestamp.
2. **Given** an existing house in the system, **When** I update house details, **Then** the updated information should persist correctly.
3. **Given** multiple houses exist in the system, **When** I list houses, **Then** all houses should be returned with their complete information.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a house name is empty or contains invalid characters?
- How does system handle duplicate house names?
- What if no address is provided for a house?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create houses with a unique name and optional address
- **FR-002**: System MUST store house metadata including creation timestamp and last modified timestamp
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to retrieve individual houses by ID
- **FR-004**: System MUST support listing all houses in the inventory
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to update house details including name and address
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow deletion of houses (with appropriate cascade behavior for child entities)
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that house names are unique within the user's inventory
- **FR-008**: System MUST support Gridfinity-specific container dimensions for visual reference and organization purposes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **House**: Represents a residential location with properties:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
  - `name`: Human-readable name of the house (required, unique)
  - `address`: Physical address of the house (optional)
  - `total_area`: Total area in Square Feet, Square Meeters, or Korean Pyeong (optional)
  - `unit`: Unit of measurement for total area (square feet, square meters, or pyeong)
  - `created_at`: Timestamp when house was created
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp when house was last updated

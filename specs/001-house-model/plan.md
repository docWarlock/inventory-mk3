# Implementation Plan: House Model

**Feature**: House Model  
**Branch**: 001-house-model  
**Status**: Draft

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of the House model for the home inventory system following Spec Driven Development and TDD principles. The House model is the root entity in our hierarchical structure (House → Room → Location → Container → Item).

## Project Structure
Based on the project specifications, we'll follow this structure:
```
cmd/server/main.go
internal/
  houses/     handler.go, service.go, repository.go, models.go
  models/     models.go
  database/   db.go, migrations/
pkg/
  middleware/ auth.go, logging.go
  config/     config.go
tests/
  houses_test.go
go.mod
README.md
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup and Dependencies
1. Create house-related files in internal/houses/
2. Define House model structure
3. Set up database connection for houses
4. Create repository interface and implementation
5. Create service layer for house operations
6. Create HTTP handlers for house endpoints

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
1. Implement house creation endpoint (POST /houses)
2. Implement house retrieval by ID (GET /houses/{id})
3. Implement house listing (GET /houses)
4. Implement house update (PUT /houses/{id})
5. Implement house deletion (DELETE /houses/{id})

### Phase 3: Testing
1. Write contract tests for all endpoints
2. Write integration tests for business logic
3. Write unit tests for models and services
4. Ensure all tests fail before implementation
5. Implement code to make tests pass

## Technical Details
- **Database**: SQLite (for MVP, can be extended)
- **Model Fields**:
  - `id`: UUID string
  - `name`: String (required, unique)
  - `address`: String (optional)
  - `dimensions`: JSON object for standard dimensions (optional)
  - `created_at`: Timestamp
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp

## Test Scenarios
1. Create house with valid data
2. Create house with duplicate name (should fail)
3. Retrieve existing house by ID
4. List all houses
5. Update house details
6. Delete house
7. Handle invalid input gracefully

## Dependencies
- Database connection module
- Authentication middleware
- Common model structures
- Testing framework (Go testing)

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass
- House CRUD operations work correctly
- Data integrity maintained
- API endpoints return correct responses
- Follows clean architecture principles

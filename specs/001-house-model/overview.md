# Project Overview: Home Inventory System (HIS)

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Initial Documentation

## Project Vision

The Home Inventory System (HIS) is a modular, self-hosted application designed to catalog every item in your home using a hierarchical structure: `House → Room → Location → Container → Item`. The system incorporates Gridfinity-based organization for visual reference while maintaining standard measurements for all other aspects.

## Core Principles

1. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns following SOLID principles
2. **TDD-First Development**: Tests drive implementation decisions
3. **Spec-Driven Development**: All features begin with comprehensive specifications
4. **Scalable Design**: Support for growth from personal to multi-house inventory management
5. **Cyberpunk UI**: Modern, visually striking interface with dark/light themes

## Documentation Structure

### Feature-Specific Documents
Each feature follows a standardized structure:
- `spec.md`: Feature specification and user requirements
- `plan.md`: Implementation approach and technical details  
- `research.md`: Technical decisions and architecture considerations

### Document Relationships

```
specs/
├── 001-house-model/
│   ├── spec.md          # House model feature spec
│   ├── plan.md          # House model implementation plan
│   └── research.md      # House model technical research
├── 002-room-model/      # Future feature example
│   ├── spec.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── research.md
└── ...
```

## How Cline (Agent) Uses These Documents

### Context Management
- **Feature Discovery**: Cline will look for the next unimplemented feature in the specs directory
- **Document Parsing**: All feature documents are parsed to understand requirements, approach, and decisions
- **Task Generation**: Based on spec and plan, Cline generates specific implementation tasks

### Implementation Workflow
1. **Spec Review**: Understand user needs and functional requirements
2. **Research Validation**: Confirm technical approach matches project constraints  
3. **Plan Execution**: Follow documented implementation steps
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Write contract tests first, then implementation
5. **Documentation Updates**: Keep all documents current with implementation changes

### Decision Making Process
- All decisions should be traceable back to the original spec and research
- Technical choices should align with project's core principles
- Implementation should be modular and maintainable
- Future extensibility considerations should be documented

## Feature Implementation Lifecycle

### 1. Specification Phase
- Create `spec.md` with user scenarios and requirements
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Identify key entities and data structures

### 2. Research Phase  
- Create `research.md` documenting technical decisions
- Analyze constraints and dependencies
- Plan architecture patterns and security considerations

### 3. Planning Phase
- Create `plan.md` with implementation steps
- Define testing strategy
- Outline success criteria

### 4. Implementation Phase
- Follow TDD approach: tests first, then code
- Implement according to documented plan
- Update all documents as changes occur

## Integration Points

### Database Layer
- Shared database connection in `internal/database/`
- Migrations handled through standard Go tools
- UUID primary keys for global uniqueness

### API Layer  
- RESTful endpoints following standard patterns
- Authentication middleware applied consistently
- Error handling and logging across all services

### UI Integration
- JSON APIs support cyberpunk UI design
- Breadcrumb navigation and search functionality
- Hierarchical path representation in all data structures

## Future Expansion Considerations

### Database Support
- Current: SQLite (MVP)
- Future: PostgreSQL, MySQL extensions

### Feature Modules
- Room grid visualization with Z-axis support
- Container-specific Gridfinity dimensions  
- Advanced search with filtering capabilities
- Multi-user and sharing features

### Performance Enhancements
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Index optimization for large inventories
- Asynchronous processing for bulk operations

## Governance and Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Standards
- All code must pass existing tests before merging
- Documentation updates required with each feature
- Modular design enforced through code organization

### Testing Requirements
- Contract tests for all API endpoints
- Integration tests for business logic  
- Unit tests for models and services
- End-to-end workflow testing

## How to Contribute

1. **Feature Request**: Create a new directory in `specs/` with feature number prefix
2. **Documentation**: Follow existing templates for spec, plan, and research documents
3. **Implementation**: Use TDD approach with test-driven development
4. **Review**: All changes should be traceable back to specification

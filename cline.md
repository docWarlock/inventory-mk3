- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for project operations
- **templates/**: Documentation templates for plans, specs, and tasks

## Project Structure and Sprints

The `specs/` directory represents major sprints within the tasks process, with each subdirectory containing the specification, plan, research, and task breakdown for a specific feature or model implementation.

### Current Sprint Tasks

Based on the specifications in the `specs/` directory, the current implementation tasks are:

### House Model Implementation

## Project Constitution

The project follows a constitution-based development approach that emphasizes:

1. **Library-First** development approach
2. **CLI Interface** standards 
3. **Test-First** methodology (TDD)
4. **Integration Testing** focus areas
5. **Observability**, **Versioning**, and **Simplicity** principles

## Update Process

This document should be updated as tasks are completed to maintain current context. Each sprint in the `specs/` directory represents a major milestone in the project development process.
